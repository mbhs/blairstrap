# Blairstrap

Blairstrap is the official Bootstrap skin for all modern Blair websites. It is
built and served from https://static.mbhs.edu.

## Planning

Blairstrap will be set up with GitHub hooks. When a branch commit is received,
the server will rebuild Bootstrap to reflect the changes and move them to 
the branches distribution location.
